Skin Disease Detection
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting skin diseases from images. It also includes a web application that allows users to upload images and receive predictions from the trained model.

Project Overview
Skin diseases are common, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project utilizes deep learning techniques to classify various skin conditions based on images. The model is integrated into a Flask web application, providing an easy-to-use interface for real-time predictions.
